# Faster Data Prep in Python

This project contains a template ipython notebook with a series of python 'routines' to support faster data prep for machine learning.
These were shared in the following presentations 
* Oct 2020 [presentation](https://bit.ly/2Sinpyp) to the [Datasoc/Atlassian Datathon](https://unswdata.com/)
* Jun 2018 [presentation](http://bit.ly/2y8hnce) to the [Data Science Breakfast Sydney](https://www.meetup.com/The-Sydney-Data-Science-Breakfast-Meetup-Group/) meetup group.
