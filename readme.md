# Faster Data Prep in Python

This project contains a template ipython notebook with a series of python 'recipes' to support faster data prep for machine learning.
This notebook was prepared as part of a [presentation](http://bit.ly/2y8hnce) on this topic to the [Data Science Breakfast Sydney](https://www.meetup.com/The-Sydney-Data-Science-Breakfast-Meetup-Group/) meetup group.
